## Who has the better program? Professor vs. Students
We are given 3 tests and we will see who's code will pass more tests. 

# NOTE: 
The definition of a link will be set by the url that the hyperlink will take you when clicked 

AND 

if the url is valid. `a.com(())` is invalid because you don't see any websites with characters after the .com except characters after a `/`

Basically, anything anything within brackets should be the hyperlink text and everything in the url must look valid.
